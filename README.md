# Bravo-Work-Scheduler

The purpose of this challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The daily planner creates a work schedule for employees to use to clock in. The current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar. The work schedule is comprised of time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When employees click on the timeblocks they can enter an event and save it. The event will be saved in local storage and remain on the schedule even when the page is refreshed.
